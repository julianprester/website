Alright I'm just going to do it.
I'm going to try out this [working in public](https://press.stripe.com/working-in-public) thing.

- Initial commit for a blog
- Trying to do more working in public
- As academic we are already doing that more than other professions
- But we focus on making public the final product of our work only: research papers
- Here I will focus on making the process toward the final product public
- Some things I will write about here:
  - Notes about interesting research papers; similar to what I have been doing for a few years already with my bookshelf
  - Ideas that stand on their own rather being fully dependent on a paper; the idea here is that these will ideally be developed into research papers later on; ideas will mostly focus on our digital future of work; nomadic organisations and working-from-anywhere; as well as probably some AI related stuff as these seems to be what everyone is talking about these days
  - More technical posts: these can be either about tools and techniques I have learned about recently or projects that I am working on myself that I feel are ready to be shared
- There will also be a sidebar with shorter posts that are almost just tweets; these are based on interesting links I find on the internet; several such posts will ideally be developed into a longer post later on
